Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
=====================

The contents of this repository constitute my submission of the peer-graded assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.
In addition to the README file, this repository contains the following files:

a.	output.txt: this file includes a tidy data set with the average of each variable (measurements on the mean and standard deviation) for each activity (eg. "Laying", "Walking Upstairs", etc.) for each subject (participant/volunteer). 

b.	run_analysis.R: this files contains the R code that is necessary to run the analysis and generate that output file listed above.

c.	CodeBook.md: this file describes the variables used in code.
